##  Repository Overview

**This repository is developed by Muhammad Javed for learning and practice purposes.**

This repository contains **classical Machine Learning models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
The purpose of this repository is to build **strong fundamentals of NLP using traditional ML algorithms** before moving to advanced deep learning models.

This is **study material**, not a production-ready project.  
Each notebook focuses on **one classical NLP model**, including preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluation.

##  Learning Objectives

- Understand NLP pipelines step by step
- Learn text vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- Apply classical ML algorithms to NLP problems
- Compare performance of different models
- Prepare for interviews and academic exams

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy

##  Notebook Details

### 1️. Naive Bayes
Probabilistic classifier widely used in spam filtering and sentiment analysis.

### 2️. Logistic Regression
Baseline linear model effective for text classification.

### 3️. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Margin-based classifier suitable for high-dimensional text data.

### 4️. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Distance-based algorithm using similarity between text vectors.

### 5️. Decision Tree
Rule-based and interpretable classifier.

### 6️. Random Forest
Ensemble learning method that reduces overfitting.



##  How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Javed2005/NLP-Classical-Models.git
jupyter notebook
```

##  Future Improvements

- Add preprocessing-only notebook
- Compare BoW vs TF-IDF
- Add model performance table
- Extend to deep learning models
