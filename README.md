## 📌 Repository Overview

**This repository is developed by Muhammad Javed for learning and practice purposes.**

This repository contains **classical Machine Learning models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
The purpose of this repository is to build **strong fundamentals of NLP using traditional ML algorithms** before moving to advanced deep learning models.

This is **study material**, not a production-ready project.  
Each notebook focuses on **one classical NLP model**, including preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand NLP pipelines step by step
- Learn text vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- Apply classical ML algorithms to NLP problems
- Compare performance of different models
- Prepare for interviews and academic exams

## 📘 Notebook Details

### 1️⃣ Naive Bayes
Probabilistic classifier widely used in spam filtering and sentiment analysis.

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression
Baseline linear model effective for text classification.

### 3️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Margin-based classifier suitable for high-dimensional text data.

### 4️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Distance-based algorithm using similarity between text vectors.

### 5️⃣ Decision Tree
Rule-based and interpretable classifier.

### 6️⃣ Random Forest
Ensemble learning method that reduces overfitting.

## ❓ Why This Is Study Material (Not a Project)

- No single real-world application
- No deployment or UI
- Independent notebooks
- Focus on learning algorithms and concepts

👉 This repository is designed for **learning, practice, and revision**, not for production use.

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Javed2005/NLP-Classical-Models.git
jupyter notebook
```

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add preprocessing-only notebook
- Compare BoW vs TF-IDF
- Add model performance table
- Extend to deep learning models
